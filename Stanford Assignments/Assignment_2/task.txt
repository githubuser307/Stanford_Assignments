Before anything else, watch this five-minute video (cw: gun violence) on Youtube. The transcript can be found here.

In this part of the assignment, you will play the part of the Michael Palin, the owner of the National Cheese Emporium.

Unlike the owner in the sketch, you do have some cheeses, and you will repeatedly ask the user what cheese they would like, and then you will respond whether or not you have that cheese.

Suppose, for the following examples, that you have a list of cheeses containing "Muenster", "Cheddar", and "Red Leicester".

Begin by printing the string "Good morning. Welcome to the National Cheese Emporium!" to the console.

Next, in a loop, we will repeatedly ask the user which cheese they would like to buy. If the user enters the exact name of a cheese that you have, print a success message and end the program. If the user does not enter the exact name of a cheese that you have, print a message that contains the user's input and the reprompt the user to ask for another cheese.

The user is also allowed to enter special questions. If the user enters either of the strings "You... do have some cheese, don't you?" or "Have you in fact got any cheese here at all?", you must reply by listing the number of cheeses that you have in the format "We have {} cheese(s)!", along with the name of each type of cheese you have, one on each line.
